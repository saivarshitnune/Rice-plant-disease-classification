# Rice-plant-disease-classification

# Introduction
 This project focuses on developing a robust multi-class classification model to diagnose three major rice plant diseases: Bacterial Blight (BB), Brown Spot (BS), and Leaf Smut (LS). Leveraging the Rice Life Disease Dataset, which includes extensive data on the symptoms and conditions associated with these diseases, the project aims to provide an accurate and efficient solution for identifying and managing rice plant health issues.

# Dataset 
The Rice Life Disease Dataset is a comprehensive collection of 4684 high resolution images divided into three classes 
Bacterial Blight (BB) - 1604 images
Brown Spot (BS) - 1620 images
Leaf Smut (LS) - 1460 images respectively.


# Model Architecture 
 To address the challenge of accurately classifying the three diseases, a ResNet50 model was chosen due to its deep residual connections which has proven effective  in image classification tasks. The model was trained and  using the  dataset, which included labeled images representing healthy plants and those affected by BB, BS, and LS.

# Performance evaluation metrics
 Achieved an accuracy of 99.98 % , 100% recall , precision and F1 scores respectively by training on Pretrained ResNet50 0n imagenet dataset.

 # Conclusion 
 This project showcases the potential of deep learning models, particularly ResNet50, in addressing agricultural challenges. By accurately diagnosing and classifying rice plant diseases, this model contributes to better crop health and yield, ultimately supporting sustainable agriculture practices.
